### ABOUT 

The COVID Risk Factor/Exposure Calculator is a small multiscreen test application that a user can take on themselves to check their risk of exposure percentage to COVID-19. The main aim of this application is just to tell if their is a chance of the person taking this test getting exposed to COVID-19. The factors used to actually calculate the result are taken from the official WHO website for COVID related FAQs.
